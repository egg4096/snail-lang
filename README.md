# snail-lang
the snail programming language, compiled to Java, supports writing parts of the code in Java, but alone only has the so called comma func, which can be used to store variables, import libraries, and print.

storing variables:
`5,, int number`

importing libraries:
`java.util.Scanner,, libs`

printing:
`"Hello, world",, out`

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

download the code, and open it up in a Java editor of your choice. Inside of snail-lang-master, create a module called src, and open it up to reveal an automatically created src folder (i have no IDEA if this would work on Eclipse, sorry). Inside the automatically created src folder, put all files except README.md and LICENSE.
